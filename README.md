# Integrate Material-UI and React Final Form

In order to integrate MUI and RFF, you need to create a thin wrapper in order to pass properties to the various components. This project provides a set of well tested, modern components.

Take a look at the [demo](https://lookfirst.github.io/mui-rff/), [example source code](https://github.com/lookfirst/mui-rff-demo/tree/master/example) and the [tests](https://github.com/lookfirst/mui-rff-demo/tree/master/test).
