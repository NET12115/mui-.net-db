# Integrate Material-UI and React Final Form

In order to integrate MUI and RFF, you need to create a thin wrapper in order to pass properties to the various components. Figuring out the nuances is non-trivial, so let us do it for you. This project provides a set of well tested, modern components that makes it easy to drop into your own project.

Take a look at the [demo](https://lookfirst.github.io/mui-rff/), [example source code](https://github.com/lookfirst/mui-rff/tree/master/example) and the [tests](https://github.com/lookfirst/mui-rff/tree/master/test).

This is a best effort implementation. If there is some customization that you require, we welcome issues or pr's!

# Usage

`yarn add mui-rff`
