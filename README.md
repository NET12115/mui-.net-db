# Integrate Material-UI and React Final Form

In order to integrate MUI and RFF, you need to create a thin wrapper in order to pass properties to the various components.

This project provides a well tested, modern, thin wrapper around Material-UI and React Final Form.

Take a look at the [example](https://github.com/lookfirst/mui-rff-demo/tree/master/example) source code and the [tests](https://github.com/lookfirst/mui-rff-demo/tree/master/test).
